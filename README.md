# JDBI Example Project

This project is a demonstration how to use Java with PostgreSQL with JDBI and Liquibase

* JDBI is a high-level API built on top of JDBC. It simplifies database interactions by reducing boilerplate code and providing a more user-friendly and declarative approach to database operations. 
* The project connects to PostgreSQL with Liquibase. 
* During testing, it connects to H2 in-memory database with test data to run unit tests.

# Getting Started

## Reducers

Jdbi reducers are a feature that helps you efficiently map SQL query results into complex object graphs, such as a Customer with their Orders and each Order's Payments.

Customer: Has many Orders.
Order: Has many Payments.

You want to fetch a Customer with all their Orders, and for each Order, all its Payments.

#### How Jdbi Reducers Work
* Single SQL Query: Write a SQL query that joins customers, orders, and payments.
* Row Mapping: Each row in the result set contains data for a customer, an order, and a payment.
* Reducer: Jdbi's reducer collects rows and assembles them into the nested object structure.

## Transactions/Rollbacks

When deleting a Customer that has related orders with payments or an Order that has related payments and order items or Products that has related order items, we use Jdbi useTransaction, which is used to execute a block of code within a database transaction. If any exception is thrown inside the block, the transaction is rolled back automatically; otherwise, it is committed. 
* See example: src/main/java/com/vcarrin87/jdbi_example/services/CustomerService.java #deleteCustomer()
* See example: src/main/java/com/vcarrin87/jdbi_example/services/OrdersService.java #deleteOrders()
* See example: src/main/java/com/vcarrin87/jdbi_example/services/ProductsService.java #deleteProduct()

## Models explained

* **Customer**: Represents the person placing the order. Stores details such as customer ID, name, contact information, and address. Each order is linked to a specific customer.
* **Product**: Represents an item available for purchase. Contains information like product ID, name, description, price, and current inventory level. Products are referenced in OrderItems.
* **Payment**: Records how an order was paid for. Includes payment ID, order ID, payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal), payment status, and transaction details. Each payment is linked to a specific order.
* **Order**: Represents the overall purchase (who, when, total, etc.).
* **OrderItems**: Represents each product in the order (productId, quantity, price, etc.).
- When a customer places an order, they usually buy multiple products. Each product is an OrderItem linked to the main Order via its ID. You need to record which products (and how many) are part of the order. This is done by inserting each OrderItem into the order_items table, using the new orderâ€™s ID.
* **Inventory**: You must decrease the stock for each product sold.

We combine all of these in OrdersService #placeOrder()

### Swagger-UI

Swagger UI provides a web-based interface to visualize and interact with the API's endpoints.
To access Swagger UI:
1. Start the application server.
2. Open a web browser.
3. Navigate to the Swagger UI URL, typically in the format: `http://<server_address>:8090/swagger-ui/index.html`.
4. Use the interface to explore available API endpoints, view request/response schemas, and test API calls.
